# Contributions, Support, and Reporting Issues

The current code version can benefit from a series of user contributions, which are most welcome. These include:  

- Extension to other element types (i.e. higher-order elements)  
- Extension to other non-linear solvers (i.e. force-controlled arc-length)  
- Extension to other damage or phase-field models  
- Extension to 3D problems  
- Extension to multi-physics considerations, combining damage with other phenomena (i.e. heat transfer)

For contributions, support, or to report an issue, users can open an issue on GitHub or contact:  <br />
