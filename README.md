# Parallel-CDM

This repository contains a MATLAB-based code and the relevant documentation to solve Computational Damage Mechanics (CDM) problems in parallel. This is a significantly enhanced and updated version of a serial-based CDM code published [here](https://github.com/roshanphilip/UAL-codes). The repo contains the following folders:

**a)	Paper:** contains the article files  <br /> 
**b)	Code:** contains all the code files  <br /> 
**c)	Documentation:** contains a document with a thorough explanation of the code functionalities, limitations, how-to-run instructions, and more. <br /> 
**d)	Test Problems:** contains the mesh details and hyperparameters for several benchmark problems <br /> 

We invite you to explore our parallel-based code to substantially accelerate computationally intensive CDM simulations. We welcome contributions from the community â€“ a list of potential aspects for improvement are listed in the associated Documentation file (see Section IX).
